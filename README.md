# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
The objective is to understand the dataset through statistics and
visualizations before applying any machine learning models.

## Notebook
- project5mlregression.ipynb

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## EDA Steps Performed
1. Imported and inspected the dataset
2. Checked shape, columns, and data types
3. Handled missing values
4. Analyzed statistical summary
5. Visualized data distributions
6. Studied relationships between variables
7. Identified patterns and insights

## Key Insights
- Observed trends and patterns in the data
- Identified outliers and missing values
- Understood feature distributions and correlations
